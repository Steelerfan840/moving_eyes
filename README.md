Title: Moving Eyes

Description: Using Javascript I created these eyeballs. The eyeballs move across the screen following your mouse as if they are watching it.

Directions: Download all files from the repository. Then upload them to your server, once they are uploaded, load index.html into your browser. 

Future Improvements: In the near future I plan on changing the looks of this by modifying the .CSS file. What changes I make will be a surprise. I like to start coding and just letting stuff happen.
